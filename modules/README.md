# Local Raiden API

## Introduction

The Node.js modules here provide convenience wrappers around two separate APIs related to Raiden:

1. My [Raiden client API](RaidenClient.md)

    * An interface to the Raiden client REST API, which is documented [here](http://raiden-network.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rest_api.html)

2. My [Raiden contract API](RaidenContracts.md)

    * An interface to the Raiden contracts on the blockchain. This is just a light wrapper around the Web3.js module, and deals only with the "constant" methods on the contracts.

Follow the links above for detailed documentation.
